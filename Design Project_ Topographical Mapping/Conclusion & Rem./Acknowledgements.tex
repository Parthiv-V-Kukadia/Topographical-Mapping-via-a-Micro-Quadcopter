The group thanks 'Tim Bretl' for providing the possible solutions to obtaining the absolute and relative z-position of the drone, as well as debugging issues regarding the drone not collecting data during flight tests. \\
\indent Parthiv Kukadia and Pallavi Ravada thank 'Travis Zook' for helping brainstorm potential challenges that could be faced implementing a loco-positioning system and understanding how to extract the absolute and relative z-position using the flow deck.\\
\indent Ani Pirosmanishvili and Salam Mulhem thank 'Max Kolarich'$^*$ for helping us conduct the flight tests and extracting position and orientation of the drone from the stock controller. \\
\indent The group thanks Dan Block for providing the crazy-flie drone, the flow deck, as well as the lab space for testing.
