The key milestone this week will be to use the final controller from the Week of November 15 to successfully produce a 3d topographical map of the object of the known height and 2d surface map. The produced visualizations should be accurate replications of the real world object filled grid. The same flight that as in the week of November 15 will be done. The x,y and z positions will be collected from this flight which then will be used to visualize a 3D topographical and 2D surface map of the filled grid using Python.
